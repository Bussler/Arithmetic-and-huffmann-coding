# Arithmetic-and-huffmann-coding
# Implementation of the Hufman and Arithmetic Coding compression techniques for efficient encoding of data

#### How to use

After compilation the program is used with the following 3 arguments: Enclosed arguments indicate to choose one:


`./compression filename (huffman/ac) (encodng/decoding)`

Example encoding with huffman compression:

`./compresstion test.txt huffman encoding`

Example decoding with AC compression:

`./compresstion test.txt ac decoding`
