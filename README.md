# Arithmetic-and-huffmann-coding
Implementation of the Hufman and Arithmetic Coding compression techniques for efficient encoding of data

Call in console with three arguments: 1) name of file to encode or decode 2) huffman/ ac 3)encoding/ decoding
Example: test.txt huffman encoding -> will encode the test.txt with huffman encoding and safe in file "encoded.txt"
         encoded.txt huffman decoding -> will decode the encoded.txt with huffman encoding and safe the decoded file in "decoded.txt"
